# python-voronoi
### Introduction
This project is designed to produce Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangularization in n-dimensions

### Testing
To run a set of tests, run `python -m pyVor.tests.testPredicates` where you replace `testPredicates` with the test you wanna run. In the future add a `__main__.py` to tests to hopefully run them all.

### Running Arbitrary Files
`python -m pyVor.path.to.file`
